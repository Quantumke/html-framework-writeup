##Zurb Foundation

Foundation is the first and most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world. It lets you quickly prototype and create sites and apps that work on any device (smartphones up through desktops and TV displays) with a library of tested components.

Foundation doesn’t require any particular back end. In fact, Foundation has been used with dozens of back-end and CMS technologies.

##What are Front-end Frameworks?
Just like there are frameworks for building native app interfaces (like Xcode for iOS), Foundation is a framework to build the front-end, or client-facing part, of a website or web application. Foundation runs entirely in the browser, so it’s easy for a Design or UX specialist to get into and work on locally without involving IT.
